We definitely did not reach our end goal for our software. However, this is definitely a product I would like to finish at some point down the road. 

Some items we didn't implement that we had intended to were:
	-Pitch Shifting for slices
	-GUI for selecting Loops 
	-Option to use multiple sample files

Despite coming up short I still really enjoyed this project and found it utterly inspiring to work on a problem that was both so involved and complex. 

Thanks for the awesome class Uri!
